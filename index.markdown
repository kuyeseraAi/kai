**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is an area that is both old and new. It is **old** because it is one of the oldest area in computer science. The term AI was coined by one of the "founding fathers" of AI, John McCarthy, in 1956. AI aims to build intelligent machines that can do the same kind of intelligent tasks humans can do: problem solving, understanding speech etc. 

It is **new** because while significant progress has been made, the initial questions raised by AI are as relevant and open as ever. In the seminal book on AI, "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach", Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig  state that the building of AI requires one to address some deep questions: 

1. Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions? 
2. How does mind arise from a physical brain? 
3. Where does knowledge come from? 
4. How does knowledge lead to action? 

McCarthy wrote in 1955: "The study (of AI) is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." Hence, in the early days as today, the emphasis was on developing programming languages / algorithms and formal systems for knowledge representation and reasoning that can equip machines with AI. 

The Turing test that any intelligent machine should be capable of passing, required that AI acquires the following capabilities: 
(a) natural language processing (NLP); 
(b) knowledge representation; 
(c) automated reasoning; 
(d) machine learning (ML). 

The Total Turing test required additional two qualities: (e) computer vision and (f) robotics. All these areas have over the years withness significant breakthroughs. 

Natural Language Processing and expert systems were extremely vibrant areas of research in the early days and have again come at the forefront of AI research. ML and Deep Learning (DL), once modest area of AI, have established itself as the leading techniques for building AI. 

The AI community is once again anticipating the coming of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Narrow AI refers to an intelligent machine capable of performing one type of intelligent task, while AGI refers to an intelligent machine that performs multiple intellgent actions similar to what humans can do. And to achieve AGI, one needs to equip an AI (agent or program) with knowledge and reasoning. This is where Big Data and the internet has played a major role. The shift from logical reasoning to a DL- or ML-based reasoning seems to characterise the recent trends in AI research and discussions.

AI is old and new. **It is also universal.** While a few years ago, research and development in AI happened at a few top universities and companies, today, all organisations are expected (and are using to various degrees) AI technology. Continents such as Africa have started to play an important role in the AI research and discussions. A lot of that has to do with "big data".

AI is meant to solve complex and hard problems. This requires sustained engagement in developing research, datasets and practical applications. Hence, establishing an AI lab just like ours is essential to progress.

We need to explain especially to Chichewa speakers how this name came about. "Kuyesera" can be used to translate both the words "test" or "experiment". So one can use "kuyesera" for something that may fail during experimentation and may never be used. Or one may mean something that is being tested with the expectation of success and of resulting in an outcome. Both meaning are understood. Here is a comparison between testing versus experimenting taken from wikidiff:

"A test is a trial a withness, while an experiment is a test under controlled conditions made to either demonstrate a known truth, examine teh validity of a hypothesis, or determine the eficacy of something previously untried".

We aim to do **both testing and experimenting in the Kuyesera AI Lab**. We want to know how AI techniques, tools, algorithms can be used to solve real problems in Malawi. It is not always easy for a non-expert to differentiate between what constitutes an AI-based solution from a solution found with other means or methods. Similarly, it is not trivial to understand why, how and to what extent an AI solution is better than one say based on general classes of algorithms / methods. 

We hear a lot of talk and discussions surrounding Ethics of AI, in particular AGI even in countries like Malawi. Experts and non-experts can understand the fact that an autonomous intelligent machine (non-human) which makes decissions unaided by humans may decide to act in a harmful way. Technology is border-less to some extent too. So while certain AI development is not at the moment or cannot be done in Malawi, one cen certainly test and experiment with AI. Such experimentation enriches understanding and capacity to use AI for solving challenges and problems in Malawi. 

**This is the mission of the Kuyesera AI Lab: to facilitate debate, discussions, to create a channel for exchange of ideas, to foster innovation and to bring together those engaged with exploring or actively using AI in Malawi (and beyond). **
