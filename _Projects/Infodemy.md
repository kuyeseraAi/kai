Infodemiology / Infoveillance can be defined as the science of distribution and determinants of information in an electronic medium, specifically the Internet, or in a population, with the ultimate aim to inform public health and public policy. Infodemiology data can be collected and analyzed in near real time. We developed an aggregator of news and academic articles focussing on covid-19 in Malawi and Kenya. We are using this to test AI algorithms for automatic keyword extraction and summarisation.
