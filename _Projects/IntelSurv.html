        <p>
            â€œAmelia Taylor of Malawi University of Business and Applied Sciences in Malawi
            will employ Large Language Models (LLMs), including ChatGPT and MedPalm, to develop
            a tool to streamline the collection, analysis, and use of COVID-19 data. Collecting
            accurate and comprehensive data during a pandemic is critical for response efforts
            but the process is labor-intensive. During COVID-19 surveillance, there were also
            limited training materials available to explain specialized concepts for data collection
            to the multidisciplinary teams.

        <p> The response of Malawi to COVID-19 highlighted the significance of surveillance data in shaping effective disease
            control strategies. The current system involves gathering client data manually by district health workers using
            paper-based COVID-19 Case Based Surveillance (CBSR) forms. This information is consolidated in an Excel line list
            database submitted to the Public Health Institute of Malawi (PHIM). The shared data is further consolidated with
            other district data for public dissemination and disease response planning

        <p> In September 2022, the Public Health Institute of Malawi granted the INSPIRE PEACH project access
            to national COVID-19-line list data. The project aimed to harmonize population health data across
            diverse entities and was led locally by Dr Amelia Taylor of the Malawi University of Business and
            Applied Sciences (MUBAS). However, upon accessing the data, several discrepancies were
            discovered. Dr Amelia and I discussed the gaps in detail and in consultation with PHIM, developed
            qualitative research questions to investigate the COVID-19 data collection processes and reasons for
            discrepancies at District Health Offices (DHO).
