        <span class="drop-cap">I</span>n September 2022, the Public Health Institute of Malawi granted the INSPIRE PEACH project access
        to national COVID-19-line list data. The project aimed to harmonize population health data across
        diverse entities and was led locally by Dr Amelia Taylor of the Malawi University of Business and
        Applied Sciences (MUBAS). However, upon accessing the data, several discrepancies were
        discovered. Dr Amelia and I discussed the gaps in detail and in consultation with PHIM, developed
        qualitative research questions to investigate the COVID-19 data collection processes and reasons for
        discrepancies at District Health Offices (DHO). After conceptualizing and documenting the research
        project, we decided to undertake the research in Lilongwe, which reported the second-highest
        number of COVID-19 cases in the country.

        On May 1st, 2023, we presented the project to the Lilongwe district Health Office Research
        Committee, who granted a letter of approval the following day. We contacted participants and
        conducted a total of 4 FGDs the following week, grouping participants according to their cadres of
        clinicians, Environmental Health Officers, Health Surveillance Assistants, and Laboratory Technicians.
        Dr Amelia Taylor conducted the one-on-one interviews involving the clinical lead and Laboratory
        lead for the COVID-19 response and the District Environmental Health Officer.

        Two experienced research assistants facilitated the Focus group discussions, and participants were
        provided with snacks, refreshments, and transport reimbursement. The data collection process for
        the FGDs and interviews was finalized within two weeks, and the data collected was well stored and
        secured on the project&#39;s laptop. The health workers were pleased with the FGDs and felt it was a
        rare opportunity to share their experiences and provide their opinions.

        After completing the data collection process, we assigned one of the research assistants to
        transcribe the recordings. The transcripts were made available for thematic data analysis within two
        weeks.
