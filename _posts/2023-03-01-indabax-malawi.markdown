IndabaX Malawi are annual gathering of people in Malawi who are interested in AI, Machine Learning, Data Science and in general technology. 

But how did these events start iun Malawi? Rollback to 2018. An email with the Deep Learning Indaba event to be held at Stellenbosch hit my inbox. A colleague from another department forwarded it by chance on the staff mail. When I saw it, I had no hesitation that this was an event I should attend: a machine learning event with participants from all over Africa! I was impressed by what I saw at Deep Learning Indaba in Stellenbosch, the vibe was phenomenal. Through this events I saw how great minds can inspire young minds to dream and gain courage to try hard stuff like machine learning. I met wonderful people that have become research buddies. And in my case, from this small seed, IndabaX Malawi was born in 2019, just like many other IndabaXs were born in other African countries. Many things have happened since 2018, including the opening of the first AI Google Lab in Africa. I have no hesitation in saying that Deep Learning Indaba energised and ignited a vision for machine learning research in Africa.

IndabaX Malawi has been held at MUBAS and Mzuni and in collaboration with MUST and KuHES. The organising team has comprised of lecturers and students from three instititions, although the main hub has been at MUBAS. 

Here is a short report on the [event we held in 2022][2022_googlereport].
