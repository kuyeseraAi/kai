The **Kuyesera AI Lab** has several projects ongoing. We list them below and provide a short description and links to individual project pages.


### Inspire PEACH

This project proposes to develop the key elements of a coordinated Pan-African COVID-19 data ecosystem using [OHDSI/OMOP] [OHDSI]. The aim is to build a robust suite of data standards and technologies, diverse data integration methodologies, using the power of AI and DS for analysis and oversight through a trusted governance and policy environment.

### Infodemy

Infodemiology / Infoveillance can be defined as the science of distribution and determinants of information in an electronic medium, specifically the Internet, or in a population, with the ultimate aim to inform public health and public policy. Infodemiology data can be collected and analyzed in near real time. We developed an aggregator of news and academic articles focussing on covid-19 in Malawi and Kenya. We are using this to test AI algorithms for automatic keyword extraction and summarisation.
