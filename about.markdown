**Kuyesera AI** Lab is based at the [Malawi University of Business and Applied Sciences][mubas-organization]. The lab was established in 2020/21 by Dr. Amelia Taylor. The lab started with projects in NLP: information retrieval for legal text and the development of annotated language datasets(Chichewa) for machine translation.

The establishment of the AI Lab then occurred naturally as teh number of projects increased and Dr. Taylor won a larger grant via the PEACH project. This enabled the recruitment of other members of the lab.

The emphasis of the lab is on research in computer science / data science / AI with a software engineering component. We aim to:

1. Develop meaningful technological solutions.
2. Conduct scaleable and ethical research.
3. Publish and disseminate our research.
4. Establish collaborations with other research groups nationally and internationally.
