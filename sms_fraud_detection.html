    <p>This research aims to provide knowledge and awareness on SMS fraud. One of the tools we want to develop is to recognize fraudulent SMSs by finding out common features of the SMSs and ways in which fraudsters can use them. To do that we need to have access to as many examples of fraudulent SMSs as possible. </p>
